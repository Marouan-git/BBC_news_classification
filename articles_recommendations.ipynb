    "### Approach:\n",
    "1. **Train a Doc2Vec Model:**\n",
    "   - Utilize Doc2Vec to transform entire articles into vector representations.\n",
    "   - Train the model to capture contextual information and semantic meaning of each document.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Compute Similarity:**\n",
    "   - Classify the article provided by the user.\n",
    "   - Measure similarity between the provided article and the other articles based on the cosine similarity of their Doc2Vec vectors.\n",
    "   - Cosine similarity provides a metric for how closely the semantic meanings align.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Recommend articles:**\n",
    "   - Provide a ranking of the articles based on the cosine similarity value.\n",
    "   - Recommend the top n articles.    \n",
    "     \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Benefits of Doc2Vec:**\n",
    "   - Doc2Vec models excel in capturing contextual nuances and semantic relationships within entire documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach enables the recommendation of article based on their semantic similarity.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "We use the BBC_News_Test.csv file to simulate non classified articles provided by the user.  \n",
    "The BBC_News_Train.csv file is used as a database of classified articles to be recommended.\n"

      "software watching while you work software that can not only monitor every keystroke and action performed at a pc but also be used as legally binding evidence of wrong-doing has been unveiled.  worries about cyber-crime and sabotage have prompted many employers to consider monitoring employees. the developers behind the system claim it is a break-through in the way data is monitored and stored. but privacy advocates are concerned by the invasive nature of such software.  the system is a joint venture between security firm 3ami and storage specialists bridgehead software. they have joined forces to create a system which can monitor computer activity  store it and retrieve disputed files within minutes. more and more firms are finding themselves in deep water as a result of data misuse. sabotage and data theft are most commonly committed from within an organisation according to the national hi-tech crime unit (nhtcu) a survey conducted on its behalf by nop found evidence that more than 80% of medium and large companies have been victims of some form of cyber-crime. bridgehead software has come up with techniques to prove  to a legal standard  that any stored file on a pc has not been tampered with. ironically the impetus for developing the system came as a result of the freedom of information act  which requires companies to store all data for a certain amount of time.  the storage system has been incorporated into an application developed by security firm 3ami which allows every action on a computer to be logged. potentially it could help employers to follow the trail of stolen files and pinpoint whether they had been emailed to a third party  copied  printed  deleted or saved to cd  floppy disk  memory stick or flash card. other activities the system can monitor include the downloading of pornography  the use of racist or bullying language or the copying of applications for personal use. increasingly organisations that handle sensitive data  such as governments  are using biometric log-ins such as fingerprinting to provide conclusive proof of who was using a particular machine at any given time. privacy advocates are concerned that monitoring at work is not only damaging to employee s privacy but also to the relationship between employers and their staff.  that is not the case   said tim ellsmore  managing director of 3ami.  it is not about replacing dialogue but there are issues that you can talk through but you still need proof   he said.  people need to recognise that you are using a pc as a representative of a company and that employers have a legal requirement to store data   he added.\n"
