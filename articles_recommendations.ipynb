    "### Approach:\n",
    "1. **Train a Doc2Vec Model:**\n",
    "   - Utilize Doc2Vec to transform entire articles into vector representations.\n",
    "   - Train the model to capture contextual information and semantic meaning of each document.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Compute Similarity:**\n",
    "   - Classify the article provided by the user.\n",
    "   - Measure similarity between the provided article and the other articles based on the cosine similarity of their Doc2Vec vectors.\n",
    "   - Cosine similarity provides a metric for how closely the semantic meanings align.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Recommend articles:**\n",
    "   - Provide a ranking of the articles based on the cosine similarity value.\n",
    "   - Recommend the top n articles.    \n",
    "     \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Benefits of Doc2Vec:**\n",
    "   - Doc2Vec models excel in capturing contextual nuances and semantic relationships within entire documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach enables the recommendation of article based on their semantic similarity.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "We use the BBC_News_Test.csv file to simulate non classified articles provided by the user.  \n",
    "The BBC_News_Train.csv file is used as a database of classified articles to be recommended.\n"
