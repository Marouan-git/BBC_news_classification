    "1. **Train a Doc2Vec Model:**\n",
    "   - Utilize Doc2Vec to transform entire articles into continuous vector representations.\n",
    "   - Train the model to capture contextual information and semantic meaning of each document.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Compute Similarity:**\n",
    "   - Measure similarity between articles based on the cosine similarity of their Doc2Vec vectors.\n",
    "   - Cosine similarity provides a metric for how closely the semantic meanings align.\n",
